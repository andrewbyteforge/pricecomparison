<h1>What is this ?</h1>

<h5>This project is a django python project. The project is being developed as a start to my portfolio and journey to being a developer. The aim is to demonstrate the skills and understanding I haveand make them appealing to future clients.

This current project named Tea Lovers is a price comparison project between asda, tesco,  sainsburys and morrisons. I am just using tea and styling the project around this to make it stand out.

The project has the following apps inside it:
asda -contains a script to scrape the named store
tesco -contains a script to scrape the  named store
sainsburys -contains a script to scrape the  named store
database -contains a script to handle the databaseside of things
interface- -contains a script html to handle everything that is seen in the gui
logging - used to provide an instance for logging
scraper- -contains a script to handle the calling of each storescraped
userare - contains register and login code.

Currently the project takes an input or inputs seperated by commas from the user using forms.py which is in the interface app. the search is named search_query. The search checks the db and returns the results.

A second part to the project is the scrapers are going to be scheduled and populate the db for the user to search against.

Results from the query are displayed per page with a specified number. Items can then be added to the basket. The basket has the same state across the pagination.

Currently only asda items added to the basket but a replication for Tesco, Sainsburys and Morrisons can easily be added.

Dont forget to makemigrations and migrate so db will populate.

Future updates coming. Please give me a like / follow if you like what you see.

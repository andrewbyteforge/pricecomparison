# Use this to log events in apps. Add name to identify app
from loggingapp.custom_logging import Logger
custom_logger = Logger('userarea').logger

Then use the following at relevant points in code:

custom_logger.info("this is custom_logger.info")  - for general info messages
custom_logger.debug("This is a debug message")   - for detailed debugging information
custom_logger.warning("This is a warning message")- for cautionary messages
custom_logger.error("This is an error message")    - for error conditions
custom_logger.critical("This is a critical error message")- system is unstable

The logs will be saved as .log files with date and time stamps, in a folder
